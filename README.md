# RectangleExample_04_03-2018

This example was presented in class (CST117, Tues/Thurs 1pm) as an introduction to the InventoryManager milestone. 
It was extended after class to include additional functionality that might be usefule in the Milestone assignment.

Note the following organization of classes:

Rectangle
//defines a Rectangle object with a name, a length and a width

                         
RectangleManager
//manages a collection of Rectangle objects in a List

This is a one to many relationship.  We say that a RectangleManager is composed of many Rectangles
